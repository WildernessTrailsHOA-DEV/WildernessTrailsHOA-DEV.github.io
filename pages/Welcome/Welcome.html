    <p><b>Welcome to Wilderness Trails Owners Association (WTOA)</b></p>
    <p>We are glad you chose to move into the WTOA community! This document welcomes you and provides initial information about the community.  The neighborhood currently has 50 developed lots and 5 lots not yet developed. The homeowners maintain a fellowship community as each property owner aids in the preservation.</p>
    <p>According to the WTOA Restrictions, there is an annual assessment of $300 due by the end of March of the current year. Since the community is not included in Jefferson County road maintenance, this annual assessment is to maintain roadways and other essential maintenance or improvements. The annual assessment does not include snow removal and salting, mowing of some common areas, and trash pickup. These variable costs are divided among homeowners and will be billed quarterly.</p>
    <p>The Annual Assessment and quarterly General Assessments can arrive by email or by USPS mail. Once you get settled, please email the board with the following information concerning your contact information and billing preference at wildernesstrailshoa@gmail.com and include the following -</p>
    <p>Name on the Account<br />
Address<br />
Phone numbers – for all homeowners (Can these be shared on the website list?)<br />
Email address – for all homeowners (Preferred for invoices? Also, can these be shared on the website list again?)</p>

    <p>You are welcome to contact any Board Member with your concerns/questions. An annual meeting occurs on the 2nd Tuesday of September of each year and new Board Members are elected during this meeting each year.</p>

    <p>Payments should be mailed to:<br />
